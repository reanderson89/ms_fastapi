# This is the Docker stack file that describes the Milestones application
#
# Do a Docker login then:
# docker stack deploy --compose-file docker-swarm.yml --with-registry-auth milestones
#
# Compose file deploy reference:
# https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/deploy/
#
# Docker stacks do not support .env files so env var substitution in this file is done during CI/CD
#
# If you omit the mode key or set it to ingress, the routing mesh is used.
